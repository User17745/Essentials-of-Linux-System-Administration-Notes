<h1>1. Linux Filesystem Tree Layout</h1>
<p><small>This section is taken from <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html" target="_blank">tldp.org</a></small>.</p>
    <h2>1.1. General overview of the Linux file system.</h2>
    <p>We have three sub topics in here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Files</li>
            <li>About Partitioning</li>
            <li>More File System Layout</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>1.1.1. Files</h3>
            <h4>1.1.1.1 General</h4>
            <p>A simple description of the UNIX system:</p>

                <blockquote>On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process.</blockquote>

                <ul>
                    <li>Above statements is an acceptable generalization and is true for Linux as well.</li>
                    <li>There are some special files as well (pipes and sockets, for instance).</li>
                    <li>Directory is also just a file containing names of other files, services, programs, images, text, etc.</li>
                    <li>Generally all devices (input/output) are also considered files by the system.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h4>1.1.1.2 Tree Layout</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We think of all files in an ordered tree like structure.</li>
                <li>This helps us manage all these file in an orderly fashion.</li>
                <li>The large branches contain more branches and the branches at the end contains leaves of the tree(files).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Sorts of Files</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong><i>Regular</i> Files</strong>: Most typical type; They contains normal data like text, executable code, input/output for/of a program, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Directories</strong>: File that are lists of other files.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Files</strong>: These are the mechanism used for input/output. Most of these files are /dev directory.</li>
                <li><strong>Links</strong>: A system to make a file/directory visible in multiple parts of the file tree.</li>
                <li><strong>(Domain) Sockets</strong>: A special file type, similar TCP/IP sockets. Provides inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control.</li>
                <li><strong>Names Pipes</strong>: Similar to sockets and form a way for processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <code>-l</code> to <code>ls</code> displays the file types using the first character of each line.</p>
