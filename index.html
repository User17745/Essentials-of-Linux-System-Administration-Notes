    <h2>1.1. General overview of the Linux file system.</h2>
    <p>We have three sub topics in here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Files</li>
            <li>About Partitioning</li>
            <li>More File System Layout</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>1.1.1. Files</h3>
            <h4>1.1.1.1 General</h4>
            <p>A simple description of the UNIX system:</p>

                <blockquote>On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process.</blockquote>

                <ul>
                    <li>Above statements is an acceptable generalization and is true for Linux as well.</li>
                    <li>There are some special files as well (pipes and sockets, for instance).</li>
                    <li>Directory is also just a file containing names of other files, services, programs, images, text, etc.</li>
                    <li>Generally all devices (input/output) are also considered files by the system.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h4>1.1.1.2 Tree Layout</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We think of all files in an ordered tree like structure.</li>
                <li>This helps us manage all these file in an orderly fashion.</li>
                <li>The large branches contain more branches and the branches at the end contains leaves of the tree(files).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Sorts of Files</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong><i>Regular</i> Files</strong>: Most typical type; They contains normal data like text, executable code, input/output for/of a program, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Directories</strong>: File that are lists of other files.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Files</strong>: These are the mechanism used for input/output. Most of these files are /dev directory.</li>
                <li><strong>Links</strong>: A system to make a file/directory visible in multiple parts of the file tree.</li>
                <li><strong>(Domain) Sockets</strong>: A special file type, similar TCP/IP sockets. Provides inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control.</li>
                <li><strong>Names Pipes</strong>: Similar to sockets and form a way for processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <code>-l</code> to <code>ls</code> displays the file types using the first character of each line (long list).</p>

            <p>A user only needs to interact with regular files, directories and links. Special files are dealt by system administrators and programmers as they are there for making the system do what the user demands. </p>

        <h3>1.1.2. About Partitioning</h3>
            <h4>1.1.2.1. Why Partition?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Even when standard installation procedure is used, Linux uses more than one partitions on a single disk.</li>
                <li>One reason for this practice is to have higher data security in case of disaster. Even if one partition gets hit, others can remain intact.</li>
                <li>In early days of Linux, <strong>journaled file systems</strong> was not present and therefore, power failure could have lead to a disaster.</li>
                <li>The use of partitions remains for security and robustness reasons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Journaled file system</strong> provides data security in case of a power failure or sudden disconnection of storage devices. But, it does not protect against bad blocks and logical errors in the file system therefore, RAID(Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) should be used in order to protect against such events.</p>
        
            <h4>1.1.2.2. Partition layout and types</h4>
                <p>There are two types of major partitions on a Linux system:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data Partition</strong>: Normal Linux system data, including <strong>root partition</strong> containing all the data to startup and run the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swap Partition</strong>: this is expansion of computer's physical memory(RAM) on hard disk.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Most systems contain:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>One root partition</li>
                        <li>One or more data partitions</li>
                        <li>One or more swap partitions</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>Systems in mixed environments may also contain partitions for other system data such as a partition for FAT/VFAT file system for MS Windows data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most systems use <strong>fdisk</strong> at the time of installation to set partition types which usually happens automatically.</li>
                    <li>Other times the user has to manually select the partition types and also do the actual partitioning.</li>
                    <li>The standard Linux partition have numbers:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>82 for swap</li>
                            <li>83 for data</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Which can be journaled (ext3) or normal (ext2, on older systems)</li>
                    <li>Linux supports a variety of other file system types apart from ext3 and ext2 such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>relatively new Reiser file system</li>
                            <li>JFS</li>
                            <li>NFS</li>
                            <li>FATxx</li>
                            <li>also many other that are natively available on other operating systems (proprietary)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>The standard <strong>root partition</strong> (indicated with a single forward slash, <i>/</i>) is about <strong>100-500 MB</strong> and contains:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>System configuration file</li>
                            <li>Most basic commands and server programs</li>
                            <li>System libraries</li>
                            <li>Some temporary space</li>
                            <li>The home directory of the administrative user</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>A standard installation requires <strong>250 MB</strong> for root partition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swap space</strong> (indicated with <i>swap</i>) is only accessible for the system itself and hidden from view during normal operation.</li>
                    <li>Swap ensure that you can keep on working on the system no matter what happens (like on normal UNIX systems).</li>
                    <li>You will virtually never see a message like <i>"Out of memory, please close some applications first and try again"</i> because of swap.</li>
                    <li>Using memory on hard disk(swap) is very slow as compared to real memory(RAM) but it offers a great comfort of having to continue working on multiple applications even with limited RAM.</li>
                    <li>Linux generally counts on having twice as much swap as the amount of RAM in the system and it can be setup in multiple of ways.</li>
                    <li>example: swap configuration on a system with 512 MB RAM could be:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 swap partition of 1 GB</li>
                            <li>2 swap partitions of 512 MB each</li>
                            <li>with 2 HDDS, 1 swap partition on each HDD of 512 MB each. (best when a lot of I/O is to be expected)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Administrator has to refer to the guidelines of the software/system being deployed to setup swap in an optimal manner for their specific applications/scenarios. Eg., Databases/Database applications might require more swap as compare to others or some systems that lack secondary memory may not need swap at all (like handhelds).
                            The swap space may also be dependent on kernel version.
                        </p>
                    <li>On many distributions, the kernel is also on a separate partition as it is the most crucial file of the OS. In which case, a you also have a <strong>/boot</strong> partition holding the kernel(s) and accompanying data files.</li>
                    <li>Rest of the HDD(s) is/are generally divided in data partitions.</li>
                    <li>It maybe that all the non-system critical data resides in one partition. (eg. a standard workstation installation)</li>
                    <li>But when non-system critical data is separate on different partitions, it is usually in this fashion:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>/usr</strong>: a partition for user programs</li>
                            <li><strong>/home</strong>: a partition containing the user's personal data</li>
                            <li><strong>/var</strong>: a partition to store temporary data like print- and mail- queues</li>
                            <li><strong>/opt</strong>: a partition for third party and extra software</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Once the partition are made, it is not advisable to change their size (although possible).</li>
                    <li>You can add more partition to the system.</li>
                    <li>On larger scales, the admin may even spread one partition over several HDDs.</li>
                    <li>A workstation or client installation is mainly intended to be used by one person alone.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            On a server, the system data tends to be separate from user data.
                            Programs that offer services are kept in a different place than the data handled by these services themselves.
                            Different partitions will be created on such systems.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                        <p>Such systems will have:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a partition with all the necessary data to boot the system</li>
                            <li>a partition with configuration data and server programs</li>
                            <li>one or more partition containing server data such as DB tables, emails, etc.</li>
                            <li>a partition with user programs and applications</li>
                            <li>one or more partitions with user specific files (home directories)</li>
                            <li>one or more swap partitions (virtual memory)</li>
                        </ol>

                </ul>
            <h4>1.1.2.3. Mount Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All partitions are attached to the system via a mount point.</li>
                    <li>Mount point defines the place of a particular data set in the file system.</li>
                    <li>Usually, all partitions are connected through the <i>root</i> partition</li>
                    <li>Empty directories are created in root partition.</li>
                    <li>These directories are the starting points for the partitions attached to them</li>
                    <li>If the Administrator wants to attach a partition to a particular of the file system, he/she has to first check of the directory exists(preferably empty) and then use the <strong>mount</strong> command in order to attach it. Once completed, the directory will contain the content of the partition.</li>
                    <li>This is how all the partitions are mounted at the time of boot (as described in /etc/fstab).</li>
                    <li>If some partitions are not constantly connected to the system, they are not mounted by default. But will be mounted automatically when detected if the system is well configured; otherwise they can be user-mountable(not necessarily administrator). (eg: camera storage, etc)</li>
                    <li>Information about the partitions and their mount points can be displayed using <strong>df</strong> command(<i>disk full/ disk free command</i>).</li>
                    <li>df command in Linux has <code>-h</code>(human readable) option which make the output more readable.</li>
                    <li>df in Linux is a GNU version and comes with more options whereas Unix has it's own version on df command.</li>
                    <li>df command can only display info about the active non-swap partitions including partitions form other systems on the network.</li>
                </ul>
